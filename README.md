# TRIAGE R Package

# Overview
The TRIAGE R package is a powerful, integrated toolkit developed by our team to decipher the regulatory complexities of transcriptome dynamics and cell identity in development and disease. 

TRIAGE R package is particularly useful for researchers focusing on:
- Transcriptome analysis to uncover regulatory gene networks, applicable to both bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq
- Discovery, characterization, and prioritization of regulatory genes
- Exploring key regulatory genes in developmental and disease contexts

# Features
- Integrated toolkit: We consolidate all TRIAGE methods into a single, cohesive package, simplifying usage for researchers with even basic R knowledge.
- User-friendly functions for regulatory gene analysis and visualization: The package provides a suite of streamlined functions that allow for seamless integration of regulatory gene analysis into standard workflows.
- Multi-species support: Extends its utility across a variety of biological models, making it versatile for different research contexts.
- Enhanced performance: Features significant improvements in computational efficiency and compatibility.
