# TRIAGE_R_Package

# Overview
The TRIAGE R package is a comprehensive suite of tools developed by our group, designed to unravel the complexities of transcriptome dynamics and cell identity in development and disease. Originally, the scattered and complex nature of the TRIAGE tools posed challenges for widespread adoption. To overcome this, we have developed an integrated, user-friendly R package that consolidates all the TRIAGE tools, streamlining their application and making them more accessible to the scientific community.

TRIAGE R package is particularly useful for researchers focusing on:
- Analysis of transcriptomic data - both bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq
- Cell differentiation processes in development and disease contexts
- Discovery and characterization of regulatory genes in cellular processes

# Features
- User-friendly integration: All TRIAGE tools are combined into a single, cohesive package, simplifying usage for researchers with even basic R knowledge.
- Enhanced performance: Significant improvements in computational speed and compatibility.
- User-friendly functions for data analysis and visualization: The package includes functions for creating publication-ready figures, aiding in data interpretation and presentation.
- Multi-species support: Facilitates research across various biological contexts, enhancing its applicability in diverse studies.
